oXml
====

oXml is java library for XML object parsing based on Streaming API for XML (StAX).

It currently contains two key classes/interfaces:
- *OxmlParser*: This is the entry point class for client usage.
- *ElementParser*: This is an interface which client users may implement to provide their own domain specific parsers. 
- *AbstractElementParser*: This is an abstract class implementing the core ElementParser API. Client users would 
   normally extend this class and override methods to provide custom parsing behaviour as required.
